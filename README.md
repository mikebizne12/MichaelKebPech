# Michael Agustin Keb Pech

This project has the following functionalities:
 - List of products
 - Create new product
 - Update an existing product
 - Delete an existing product

## Quick Start 

- Node.js (v18.19.1 recommended)
- npm (v10.2.4 recommended)
- [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) (v17.3.0 recomendada)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mikebizne12/MichaelKebPech.git
cd MichaelKebPech
npm install
ng serve
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## MVCC

Containers and Components are both Angular Components, but used in different ways.

Containers should arrange Components.

Obviously this can become subjective, but MVCC is the paradigm that we subscribe to.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via Jest.

## Running unit tests coverage

Run `npm run test:coverage` to execute the unit tests via Jest.

## Addons

Run `npm run lint` to scan the code.

Run `npm run format` to check the format code via prettier.

Run `npm run format:write` to write the format code via prettier.
